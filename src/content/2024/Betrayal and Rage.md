### **A Self-Talk on Betrayal and Rage**

#### **The Beginning**

August 13, 2023. It's 2 AM. I messaged Her on Instagram, from a comment section, to tell her something Instagram wouldn't let me say publicly. From that moment, everything seemed perfect. We clicked. We talked. We moved to the talking stage, and everything matched up so well that we started dating. It felt so right—too right.

But things were festering under the surface.

#### **Suppressed Feelings**

I kept my feelings locked up, thinking that if I showed too much of myself, people wouldn't like me. I was a people-pleaser, desperate for approval. Not anymore. Never again. 

#### **The Ex Factor**

She had this annoying habit of bringing up her ex, singing his praises. They talked a lot—long calls, sometimes 26 minutes, sometimes 12. It drove me insane. I asked her to stop, to set boundaries, but she refused. She kept talking to him, disregarding my feelings completely.

#### **The Breaking Point**

Nine months in, our exam results came out. We both didn't do as expected in NEET, India's medical entrance exam. I was shattered, already on edge. And then, he called her. Not the other way around—he called, and she received the call, happy as ever. My family was against me, and I was barely holding it together, coping at my friend's house. PG claimed he knew her, cared for her, understood her family situation. 

*"Don't talk to him, for God's sake,"* I begged. *"Don't bring this insecurity into my life right now."* 

But she refused. She said no. She wouldn't block him. She wouldn't stop talking to him. *"Don't cage me,"* she said.

#### **The Explosion**

Of course, I lost it. I fucking lost it. That night, she dropped the bombshell. *"I don't have feelings for you anymore. I'm breaking up with you tomorrow."* That piece of shit. I had introduced her to my closest friends, and she manipulated them, especially Kartik, or Kaneki, as I sometimes called him. He was my best friend, my confidant, my mirror. And she took him away, twisted his perception of me, manipulated him out of my life. 

#### **Manipulation and Betrayal**

*What the fuck, Kartik? What’s going on in your mind?* I’m not in a good mental state, and you cannot be fucking serious with me right now. How can you think I’m the one acting insane when it’s clear as day that she's the one manipulating everything? 

She is *pathetic*. She tried to take away most of my friends, those who knew me before her. But hell no, I’m not letting that happen. No way. 

#### **Aftermath**

After the breakup, she flaunted her happiness. She was matching DPs with other guys for fun perhaps, posting stories about her ex’s birthday, tagging him. It was a constant reminder of her betrayal. She was happy while I was in pieces. She tried to steal my friends, my life, but she won’t win.

#### **Reflection**

PG, you broke me. You manipulated those closest to me, flaunted your happiness while leaving me in ruins. But I won’t let your actions define me. This is my self-talk, my rage, my catharsis. You won't cage me anymore.

#### **Conclusion**

This is for me, by me. A reminder that I will rise above this. I will reclaim my life, my friends, my sanity. You won't win. You can't cage my feelings anymore.
